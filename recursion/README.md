# Recursions

Cycle of running of a block of code (the function) by calling itself based on a given condition using a stack to maintain the cycle and its evaluation is termed recursion.

A series of programs to help break down the working behind the recursion programs.

Eg: `A` calls `A` if the condition is satisifed, i (outer scoped variable) < n, then completes the parent function.

## Learning Objectives

- Sharpen recursion concepts
- Develop critical thinking and problem solving
