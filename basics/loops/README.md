# Loops

A loop is used to excute a block of code, i.e, a set of instructions that perform a set of tasks, based on a condition over iterations.

There exists two/three kinds of loops:

1. for loops
2. while loops
3. do-while loops

Eg:

```
val names = ["Kavya", "Manas", "Likitha"]
for(name in names){
    println("Good morning, $name. Have a great day.")
}
```
