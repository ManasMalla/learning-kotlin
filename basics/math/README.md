# Math

A series of programs to help understand the practical applications of the basics of Kotlin learnt so far, ranging to dealing with matrices to palindromic operations.

Eg: `addMatrices()`, `checkIfPalindrome()`, `isPrime()`

## Learning Objectives

- Mathematical applications of Kotlin
- Understanding real world usage of for loops in mathematics
- Dealing with matrices: addition, subtraction, multiplication
- Basic math operations (as per the A-Z striver)

## Programs

- [MatrixAddition.kt](MatrixAddition.kt) - A simple program in Kotlin to understand mathematic implications for loops, representation of matrices in code, and add two matrices.
- [MatrixSubtraction.kt](MatrixSubtraction.kt) - A simple program in Kotlin to understand subtract two matrices.
- [IdentityMatrix.kt](IdentityMatrix.kt) - A simple program in Kotlin to revise identity matrices and subtract two matrices to obtain an identity matrix.
- [MultiplyTwoMatrices.kt](MultiplyTwoMatrices.kt) - A simple program in Kotlin to understand the algorithm behind the multiplication of two matrices.
- [[PRACTISE] PractiseMatrixMultiplication.kt](PractiseMatrixMultiplication.kt) - A simple practise program in Kotlin to understand the algorithm behind the multiplication of two matrices.

### Programs from the A-Z Striver Sheet

- [DigitDivision.kt](OrderReciept.kt) - A simple program to find out the number of digits in a number which exactly divide a given number.
